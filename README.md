# Honours-Project
Honours Project for my final year in university, covering Incident Response, Digital Forensics and Malware Analysis.
The Honours Project artefacts are split into three folders - main, questionnaire and malware folders.

The main directory contains the generic cyber incident response plan (CIRP.docx) and the methodology documentation (Methodology.docx). 

The questionnaire folder contains the questionnaire questions (Questionnaire.docx) - Results were omitted for data privacy reasons and will be summarised in the dissertation.

The malware folder contains four additional folders:

	- File_Tour -  contains screenshots, dropped payload, and memory forensics folders. The extracted strings, analysis report, incident response plan module, and Yara rule are in its main folder.

	- Jigsaw -  contains screenshots, dropped payload, and memory forensics folders. The extracted strings, analysis report, incident response plan module, and Yara rule are in its main folder.

	- NotPetya - contains screenshots and memory forensics folders. Second-stage payloads were omitted as strings and other files were outside the scope or encrypted by the wiper. The main folder contains extracted strings, an analysis report, an incident response plan module, and a Yara rule.

	- SnakeKeylogger - contains screenshots, dropped payload, and memory forensics folders. The extracted strings, analysis report, incident response plan module, and Yara rule are in its main folder.
